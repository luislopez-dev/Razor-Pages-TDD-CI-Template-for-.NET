## Introduction

This repository is intended for educational and experimental purposes only. It is not production-ready and should not be used in live or critical environments.

## Business Logic

This project emulates an inventory and billing management system.

### Domain

<strong>Contains the core business rules.</strong>

### Application

<strong>Defines the application services and coordinates communication between the presentation layer and the business logic.</strong>

### Infrastructure

<strong>Implements technical details such as data access and external services.</strong>

### Presentation

<strong>Contains the logic that handles user interaction.</strong>

## DevOps

The repository includes a CI pipeline built with GitHub Actions. This workflow automates test execution and verifies that every change meets the defined standards. The pipeline additionally containerizes the project with Docker and deploys the resulting image to Docker Hub.

## Runtime Environment
The project uses Docker Compose for consistent environment setup. This includes SQL Server support, enabling easy replication of realistic database environments for both development and testing.

## Testing
The solution follows a TDD workflow with unit and integration tests to ensure early code quality. Additionally, Selenium is used for end-to-end testing to verify critical user flows in a real browser.
